## Project description
PilgrimPro AI is an Intelligent virtual human that interacts with you in a remarkably human-like manner. It can provide you with information about Hajj and Umrah, updated hotels information, and updated flights information. It utilizes multiple AI technologies, including LLM (GPT-4), Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Lip-Sync, enabling the creation of a talking virtual human. What sets our Intelligent Virtual Human apart is its ability to connect with you on a deeply personal level. Through text, audio, and a speaking avatar, our virtual assistant engages with you just like a real human would. It is not just a robotic voice behind a screen; it is a compassionate and knowledgeable presence that understands your needs and supports you throughout your pilgrimage preparation, and during making Hajj and Umrah.
